				It was truly a novel experience for us to
				participate in an ambitious, large-scale project
				like uLesson. Our team partly took on the job of
				market research, strategy elaboration, development,
				and of course, getting creative with visuals.
				Cuberto worked through dozens of design concepts
				throughout the lengthy collaborative process and
				successfully created an unforgettable design for the
				mobile and desktop application. Oh, and did we
				mention that we built the website from scratch?
