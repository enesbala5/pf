		<Introduction>
			Click Properties is a Real Estate company based in Tirana, Albania. It seeks to find properties for their clients,
			which will 'CLICK' the moment they lay eyes on them.
			<br /><br />
			Click Properties maintains a modern and professional profile, and being that it is a new entry on an already established
			industry, the challenge faced while building their identity, was creating a mark which would remain engrained on all
			who happened to observe it, and as to the client's liking, also tied to the concept of 'Property'.
